        <h1>King Richard</h1>
        <div>
        <p>King Richard is the story of Richard Williams, father of legendary tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams, at the very start of their careers. The Williams sisters were heavily involved in the making of the film—they wanted to make sure their father's was depicted accurately. Will Smith, who plays Richard, also wanted to make sure he got it right, saying when the film premiered, "I knew I wanted to show a father protecting a daughter... to the world."</p>

        <h1>Belfast</h1>
        <div>
        <p>Kenneth Branagh's moving semi-autobiographical drama Belfast is based in part on Branagh's own childhood in the Northern Irish capital. It follows 9-year-old Buddy as his working-class Protestant family lives through The Troubles, and features the August 1969 riots, when a group of Protestant loyalists attacked Catholics. Branagh was born in 1960 in Belfast, and like Buddy, was been 9 years old in 1969. Like Buddy, his family, too, moved to England to escape The Troubles.</p>
